  - Pre-installed multi-language support from Misaki:
    - English (en), Japanese (ja), Korean (ko),Chinese (zh), Vietnamese (vi)
  - All voice packs included for supported languages, along with the original versions.
- Enhanced Audio Generation Features:

  - Integration with https://github.com/hexgrad/kokoro and https://github.com/hexgrad/misaki packages

### Removed
- Deprecated support for Kokoro v0.19 model

### Changes
- Combine Voices endpoint now returns a .pt file, with generation combinations generated on the fly otherwise 


## [v0.1.4] - 2025-01-30
### Added
- Smart Chunking System:
  - New text_processor with smart_split for improved sentence boundary detection
  - Dynamically adjusts chunk sizes based on sentence structure, using phoneme/token information in an intial pass
  - Should avoid ever going over the 510 limit per chunk, while preserving natural cadence
- Web UI Added (To Be Replacing Gradio):
  - Integrated streaming with tempfile generation
  - Download links available in X-Download-Path header
  - Configurable cleanup triggers for temp files
- Debug Endpoints:
  - /debug/threads for thread information and stack traces
  - /debug/storage for temp file and output directory monitoring
  - /debug/system for system resource information
  - /debug/session_pools for ONNX/CUDA session status
- Automated Model Management:
  - Auto-download from releases page
  - Included download scripts for manual installation
  - Pre-packaged voice models in repository

### Changed
- Significant architectural improvements:
  - Multi-model architecture support
  - Enhanced concurrency handling
  - Improved streaming header management
  - Better resource/session pool management


## [v0.1.2] - 2025-01-23
### Structural Improvements
- Models can be manually download and placed in api/src/models, or use included script
- TTSGPU/TPSCPU/STTSService classes replaced with a ModelManager service
  - CPU/GPU of each of ONNX/PyTorch (Note: Only Pytorch GPU, and ONNX CPU/GPU have been tested)
  - Should be able to improve new models as they become available, or new architectures, in a more modular way
- Converted a number of internal processes to async handling to improve concurrency
- Improving separation of concerns towards plug-in and modular structure, making PR's and new features easier

### Web UI (test release)
- An integrated simple web UI has been added on the FastAPI server directly
  - This can be disabled via core/config.py or ENV variables if desired. 
  - Simplifies deployments, utility testing, aesthetics, etc 
  - Looking to deprecate/collaborate/hand off the Gradio UI


## [v0.1.0] - 2025-01-13
### Changed
- Major Docker improvements:
  - Baked model directly into Dockerfile for improved deployment reliability
  - Switched to uv for dependency management
  - Streamlined container builds and reduced image sizes
- Dependency Management:
  - Migrated from pip/poetry to uv for faster, more reliable package management
  - Added uv.lock for deterministic builds
  - Updated dependency resolution strategy

## [v0.0.5post1] - 2025-01-11
### Fixed
- Docker image tagging and versioning improvements (-gpu, -cpu, -ui)
- Minor vram management improvements
- Gradio bugfix causing crashes and errant warnings
- Updated GPU and UI container configurations

## [v0.0.5] - 2025-01-10
### Fixed
- Stabilized issues with images tagging and structures from v0.0.4
- Added automatic master to develop branch synchronization
- Improved release tagging and structures
- Initial CI/CD setup

## 2025-01-04
### Added
- ONNX Support:
  - Added single batch ONNX support for CPU inference
  - Roughly 0.4 RTF (2.4x real-time speed)

### Modified
- Code Refactoring:
  - Work on modularizing phonemizer and tokenizer into separate services
  - Incorporated these services into a dev endpoint
- Testing and Benchmarking:
  - Cleaned up benchmarking scripts
  - Cleaned up test scripts

  - Added comprehensive audio format conversion support (mp3, wav, opus, flac)

## 2025-01-01
### Added
- Gradio Web Interface:
  - Added simple web UI utility for audio generation from input or txt file

### Modified
#### Configuration Changes
- Updated Docker configurations:
  - Changes to `Dockerfile`:
    - Improved layer caching by separating dependency and code layers
  - Updates to `docker-compose.yml` and `docker-compose.cpu.yml`:
    - Removed commit lock from model fetching to allow automatic model updates from HF
    - Added git index lock cleanup

#### API Changes
- Modified `api/src/main.py`
- Updated TTS service implementation in `api/src/services/tts.py`:
  - Added device management for better resource control:
